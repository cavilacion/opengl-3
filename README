In this assignments we were ought to make objects move. For the first part, we succeeded to load 4 objects (2 cats and 2 spheres) and make them rotate around an axis. Also we were able to move the camera around the objects, and even succeeded in some user_input controls: zooming in and out using scrolling and dragging the mouse to move the camera around.

For the water exercise we managed to apply a multiple of sinusses to make the water move. We weren't however, due to communication errors, able to implement the Gouraud and Phong shading.
