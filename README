In this assignments we were ought to make objects move. For the first part, we succeeded to load 4 objects (2 cats and 2 spheres) and make them rotate around an axis. Also we were able to move the camera around the objectsin two dimensions, and even succeeded in some user_input controls: zooming in and out using scrolling and dragging the mouse to move the camera around.

For the water exercise we managed to apply a multiple of sinusses to make the water move. The phong shading is also implemented. The gouraud shading is disabled.
The first shader program with the height map is not in the project, beause we lost the code.
Proof of a working shader program with the height map can be found in the subdirectory Screenshots.
